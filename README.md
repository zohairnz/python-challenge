# python-challenge

In this Challenge, I was tasked with creating a Python script to analyze the financial records of a fictional company. I was given a financial dataset called budget_data.csv. The dataset is composed of two columns: "Date" and "Profit/Losses".

My task was to create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following values:
1. The total number of months included in the dataset
2. The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
3. The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes
4. The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
5. The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

The final script printed the analysis to the terminal and exported a text file with the result.

In the second part of this Challenge, I was tasked with updating a vote counting process. I was given a set of poll data called election_data.csv. The dataset is composed of three columns: "Voter ID", "County", and "Candidate". 

My task was to create a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following values:
1. The total number of votes cast
2. A complete list of candidates who received votes
3. The percentage of votes each candidate won
4. The total number of votes each candidate won
5. The winner of the election based on popular vote

The final script printed the analysis to the terminal and exported a text file with the result.
